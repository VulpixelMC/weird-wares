# Weird Wares
Weird wares for your wacky world! This mod adds various unobtainable and forgotten items, blocks, and features *plus a few extras*.

## Glitter
**Fair warning**: Excessive use of glitter may result in frame drops.

Glitter can be used to add enchantment glint to items and blocks in your world. In the inventory, select a stack of glitter, then apply (left click) the glitter on another item stack. Enchanted blocks that are placed down will appear enchanted in the world.
